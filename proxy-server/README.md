# proxy-server

Twitch api has some cors restrictions.  

So... We can use this small proxy to avoid it during the local test environment.

Without this server running, local instance of Tadashi have limited functionality.

Hosted solutions, such as [tadashi.github.io](tadashi.github.io) does not use this proxy server.
